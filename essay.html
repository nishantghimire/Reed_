        <p>In my junior year of high school, my English teacher assigned me a project to research an untaught chapter, Chapter 11. It wasn't until just four days before the end of vacation that I finally looked into the project. The chapter was titled "Connecting the Dots," a speech by Steve Jobs. While Jobs mentioned Reed College numerous times, I didn't pay much attention until he spoke about how he learned calligraphy at Reed and later made it available online. It is crazy to think that if the labels on the drawers at Reed hadn't displayed beautiful calligraphy, I wouldn't have written this essay using the sans-serif font. </p>
        <p>While I was searching for colleges, Reed suddenly emerged as an unexpected contender. I had never been one to believe in destiny until then. As I delved deeper into researching Reed, my admiration for the college only grew. Not only does Reed offer a renowned Virtual Computer Lab where I can complete my research and projects 24/7, but its location in Portland further enhances its appeal. The city hosts exceptional events like TechFestNW, providing opportunities to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and creatives like myself. Additionally, Portland Startup Week offers unparalleled opportunities to network with investors such as Mark Cuban and Reid Hoffman.</p>
        <p>"Reed students are heavily academically focused," as everyone says. Many people are complaining about the lack of sports. As someone talented in various fields, Reed can provide me with opportunities to establish several clubs for music like a band Performer, and sports like track and Field which will help me to increase my talent, management, and leadership skills. Going to Reed would not just be to learn something; it will help me to be somebody.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the thing I find most striking about Reed is its emphasis on the word “AND.” Reed students can love journalism AND astronomy, philosophy AND science, theater AND Humanities--I can love computer science AND economics. Although I do not want to major in it, I have always been interested in economics. At Reed, my interests would not be hindered by strict and unwavering guidelines. I could go from CSCI 351 - Software Engineering to ECON 345 - Financial Economics. I know that I am right for Reed and Reed is right for me because we have a mutual understanding of what education should look like--emphasis on “AND,” not “OR.”</p>
