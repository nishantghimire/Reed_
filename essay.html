        <p>Reed's location in Portland, a renowned hub of creativity and innovation where individuals are encouraged to think outside the box and pursue their passions, further enhances its appeal. Events like TechFestNW and Portland Startup Week exemplify this spirit by providing platforms for tech enthusiasts and creatives like me to come together, share ideas, and foster collaboration.</p>

        <p>"Reed students are heavily academically focused," as everyone says. Many people are complaining about the lack of sports. As someone talented in various fields, Reed can provide me with opportunities to establish several clubs for music, like a band performer, and sports, like track and field, which will help me to thrive as an athlete and musician as well as increase my management and leadership skills. Going to Reed would not just be to learn something; it will help me to be somebody.</p>

        <p> Lastly, the thing I find most striking about Reed is its emphasis on the word “AND.” Reed students can love journalism AND music theory, science AND English, poetry AND Latin History --I can love computer science AND economics. Although I do not want to major in it, I have always been interested in economics. At Reed, my interests would not be hindered by strict and unwavering guidelines.  I could go from CSCI 351 - Software Engineering to ECON 345 - Financial Economics. I know that I am right for Reed and Reed is right for me because we have a mutual understanding of what education should look like--emphasis on “AND,” not “OR.”
