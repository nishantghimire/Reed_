        <p>In my junior year of high school, my English teacher assigned me a project to research an untaught chapter, Chapter 11. It wasn't until just four days before the end of vacation that I finally looked into the project. The chapter was titled "Connecting the Dots," a speech by Steve Jobs. While Jobs mentioned Reed College numerous times, I didn't pay much attention until he spoke about how he learned calligraphy at Reed and later made it available online. It is crazy to think that if the labels on the drawers at Reed hadn't displayed beautiful calligraphy, I wouldn't have written this essay using the sans-serif font. </p>
        <p>In my high school in Nepal, I did not have many opportunities to explore larger projects due to a lack of advanced computers and budget. However, at Reed, the 24/7 service of the Math Computer Lab and Virtual Computer Lab at the Information Resource Center (IRC) will enable me to expand my boundaries with more advanced research and projects. In conversations with one of Reed's seniors, I learned about numerous events like hackathons, TechFestNW, and Portland Startup Week, which occur near the college. These events can provide me with opportunities to collaborate with passionate tech enthusiasts and creatives. What's more, I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to meet and learn from prominent investors such as Mark Cuban and Reid Hoffman at the same event.</p>
        <p>"Reed students are heavily academically focused," as many students' reviews indicate. Many people are complaining about the lack of extracurricular activities. As someone talented in various fields, Reed can provide me with opportunities to establish several clubs for music, like a band Performer, and sports, like track and Field, which will help me to increase my talent, management, and leadership skills as well as help me to thrive as both a musician and an athlete. Going to Reed would not just be to learn something; it will help me to be somebody.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the thing I find most striking about Reed is its emphasis on the word “AND.” Reed students can love journalism AND astronomy, philosophy AND science, theater AND Humanities--I can love computer science AND economics. Although I do not want to major in it, I have always been interested in economics. At Reed, my interests would not be hindered by strict and unwavering guidelines. I could go from CSCI 351 - Software Engineering to ECON 345 - Financial Economics. I know that I am right for Reed and Reed is right for me because we have a mutual understanding of what education should look like--emphasis on “AND,” not “OR.”</p>
