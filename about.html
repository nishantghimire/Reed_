        <p>A blade does not become strong and does not become tempered until it has been through the fire. The fire within me does not allow me to count the days until I am off the waitlist; it drives me to make every day count. I am not a spectator; I am a winner. I have a belief, a belief so strong that no matter how many times I fail or get waitlisted, I will wake up and face the same challenge until I win and deserve a seat at Reed.</p>

        <p>When I heard I was waitlisted, I felt bad, but my stoic mind said to me, "It is okay to receive bad news sometimes or be stuck in a place because it won't last forever. You will be what you will to be. As long as you improve your profile, work on yourself, and put in efforts, it is okay to not be okay, to be okay."</p>

        <p>One month of pure dedication toward one college â€“ do you think my dedication will fade with time? It won't until my eyes see "You're In, Nishant." I am a warrior. Many people have much stronger profiles than me, but a warrior is not always about who is strong. A warrior is someone who says, "Hey! I am here to prove you again with my work." A warrior is a person who feels beaten but chooses to NEVER EVER GIVE UP while life throws the challenges and comes back so strongly that everyone is amazed by their capability.</p>
        
        <p>The struggle of spending countless hours in the same college's work doesn't seem beautiful while I'm doing the work and going through the process, but I am just being tested by the admission committee. Without a test, there is no testimony. They want to know how badly someone wants to be at Reed, and I am the person who never stops working until I prove why I AM THE BEST.</p>
